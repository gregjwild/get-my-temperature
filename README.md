Hey there! This is a really simple project to demonstrate how easily a
Raspberry Pi can be used to serve up IoT style data from sensors, using
a basic Express based HTTP server.

## What do you need to know first?
- JavaScript: All the code is written in JavaScript, mostly using ES2015 syntax.
- Electronics - Basic: You should know how to hook your Pi up to a breadboard, and attach basic devices such as LEDs or sensors.
- HTML: You should know how to build a basic web page. Nothing too big!
- CSS: Again, you should know how to select basic elements, and style them. Nothing fancy!

If you don't know JavaScript or HTML, check out codecademy.com from quick, easy tutorials.

## What don't you need to know?
- HTTP: The workhorse of the internet! This is how webpages and data gets sent  around online.
- Node: This is the JavaScript engine that lets you use JavaScript almost anywhere.
- Express: Building your own web server in Node isn't hard, but it is a little tedious. Express will make it quick and easy. It's similar to Flask, with Python.

## Other stuff
This project is actually originally adapted from a basic app built in the book
"Express in Action" by Evan Hahn, and published by Manning Publications in 2016.
